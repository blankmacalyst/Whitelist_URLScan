# Whitelist_URLScan
An automation script for BlueTeam Professionals to attempt to automate URL whitelist requests.

It utilises a number of publicly available API services such as VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis to auto request URL analysis and return the results. 

## API Keys
Currently only two integrated APIs required to be added as environment variables: VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis. 

I hope to get some time to flesh out functionaility.
